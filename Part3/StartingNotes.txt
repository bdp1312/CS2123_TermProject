INTS

Make dynamic array[int], randomly picked 

Create menu for diferant searching algorithms

perform selected searching algorthm three times on three random arrays
	write to same array three times, compute avg.
	free array after all searches are performed
	
analize times and the algoritms by big O notation
recomend a searching algorithm

STRINGS

use file from pt 2

add option for string in menu

search for provided name

repeat at five times compute avg
	five searches on the same sorted array for same word

analize times and the algorithm's big o notation

recomend which searching algorithm
