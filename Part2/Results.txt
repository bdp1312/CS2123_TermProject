Benjamin Parrish(cbe982)

I worked with Luke DuBonis (hjt755)

The project is not compleate. We implemented interger storts and the individual string storts. The individual ints sorts were the only ones that work without errors. 

The best algorithm for intergers is by far quicksort.

Could not conclusivly say the best algorithm for strings.

We did some of the bonus test for the intergers. Though we did not make it for sorting algorithms.

We did not atempt the bonus for strings.
